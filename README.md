# Github Wars

## [Live siteðŸ”—](https://github-war-app.netlify.app/)

This is a **React** application which involves all the basic react concepts. You can find all the popular repositories on Github and in the battle section you can add usernames to battle. I have used various libraries for building this app **prop-types** for **type checking**, **babel** for converting the modern JS code to backward compatible JS code. I have used **react-router** for routing the various components.And **webpack** for bundling all the JS modules and running a dev server.
